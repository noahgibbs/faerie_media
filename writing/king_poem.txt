A faerie king is strange enough to see.
What faerie would obey one such as he?
They'll do exactly what he'll say
As long as it is "disobey!"
(Or what they would do anyway.)
You'd think they want to hang him from a tree.

A faerie king is tall and stiff and strong.
His jagged ears poke out a little wrong.
A pointed nose and piercing glare
Below his stuck-out matted hair
He's stares past like there's no-one there
As faeries dance and mock him all day long.

A faerie king hates ruling, head to toes.
But why he does it, every faerie knows.
The faerie lands will melt like cake,
The faeries briefly merry-make,
The king stands tall for all their sake.
They haven't very long before he goes.

The wooded hill sinks down into the black,
The blue sky fades, the distant mountains crack.
The king in lumps now falls apart,
The dancers go back to their start
The Green calls them with all its art
The faeries slink away and don't come back.
