Old Fae: and there's this joke, about a goblin, a leprechaun, and a point of view.

An old mortal captures a goblin and isn't sure what to do with him. And he asks it, so what are you, then? And the goblin, being captured and having not to lie outright, he says, "I'm a creature of point-of-view."

The old mortal says, "what? There's no such thing as a creature of point-of-view!"

And a leprechaun who's been watching this whole thing from the shadows jumps out and he says to the goblin, "you see? Didn't I bloody tell ye?"

You: hunh. And it's... a joke about how a goblin is really a creature of point of view?

Old Fae: Mostly it's a joke about how leprechauns are idiots.
