# The Emergence of Memories / The Memories of Emergence

Past and future merge here. Some of these are memories, some are prophecies. Some happened to you, and some happened to somebody else.

# Point of View

A memory, like a prophecy, is a little different every time you remember it. It doesn't change - each time you recall it, it was always that way, forever and ever.

A memory, like a prophecy, has a hook - something you recall it by. At the next Solstice Festival perhaps you'll smell the sickly-sweet decay of crushed lilacs, slowly fermenting into vinegar. Smell them and concentrate utterly, and you'll recall the last time you saw your lost love, the forest of Spring slowly turning to the withering heat of Summer. The smell is the hook.

Points of view are tricky and slippery. They move over and under each other. One can't brush another without changing it. As Delight slowly decomposes into Delirium with time, so too does the Safety of Home slowly become a Smothering Prison. Like memories and prophecies, they've never been different - when you look at your Smothering Prison, it has always been so. When the Safety of Home is finally gone, you can feel the hole in your heart where it was always missing.

A faerie is a creature of Point of View, and the faerie is the hook. When you see the faerie, or hear it, your heart remembers its Point of View. The faerie of the Safety of Home, if you catch a glimpse of it, is like a warm hug and cocoa by the fire. You mustn't look at the faerie of Lost Love directly or your heart will burst from the sadness of it.

A faerie is like any other sort of creature - when it is born, it is ageless and always has been. As it matures, it becomes a mortal thing, the minutes and years ticking across it. Rarely, a faerie may deign to die - and it fades into the infinite, becoming part of everything that has ever been, but also eternally gone and utterly irreplaceable. You remember it in every moment of the day and yet the specifics blur into the background, its true identity fading beyond memory.

Faeries are born constantly, and move exquisitely through the world, both like and unlike their own Points of View.

But if they die so rarely, why are we not overrun with faeries?

Ah.

Few faeries die. Many return to the Green - a wiping-away of Points of View, a forgetting that the universe uses, else it would Feel too strongly, and we would all be overwhelmed.

The Green is the birthplace of faeries. The Green is where they return to. Do faeries die inside and others come out? Is a faerie wiped clean and fresh, to come out changed? I do not know, no more than I know whether your Smothering Prison was, somehow, the same as the Safety of your Home. When next I look at the faerie that emerges it is a new thing - and always has been.
