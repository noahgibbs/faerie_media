Mexica is a plot generator. Probably worth further investigation.

nn is a narrative generator, intended for Inform/TADS-style text games.

Paper on hooking Mexica up to (parts of) nn for output: https://nickm.com/if/mexica-nn_ijwcc08.pdf

The paper models (as of page 8) every nn (narrative) event specifically. Which is odd, because it appears to have a nested structure so that you could tell different events with
different levels of importance - you'd expect the opposing of one character to another to normally be described in a single line, for instance.

Need to further research Mexica, which seems by far the more interesting of the two.
