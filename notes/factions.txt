Brainstorming:

"High" faction / Noble / Seelie
"rarefied" "exclusive" "fashion" "academic"
Stratified society, rigid expectations

"Low"/"Crude"/"Bestial" / Unseelie
Wild? Natural?
Instinctual; mutability

"Quiet" Faction
Stealth, Hiding, Spying
Some roughly in plain sight, some by being far from others
Sometimes outcasts, sometimes rebels/antisocial, most accepted into the faction, not always treated well

Splinter factions of various types, of course. "Independents" don't generally make one faction easily or long-term.

What's intermediate? What's third? No paper-scissors-rock for this. "Intermediate" is a boring answer.



If Fae are creatures of point-of-view and idea, then players are creatures of inspiration, spark and possession. Not the same as a Fae, but able to "nudge" (often) or command (in certain cases, and within limits) the Fae.




Early Game Modes:

I like the thought of lots of noncombat games, and games that "feel" like other games - social or fashion games that feel like combat, for instance, and combat that feels like preening


Fun "cognitive dissonance" between game and obvious interpetation of sides:

Imagine a "creep" dynamic for the Seelie - have to prepare ground/areas before they can use it, while the Unseelie could pop up (or fortify, or...) wherever. That also works well with the idea of Seelie as a "first" alliance, easy for new players to understand and retreat to.

I like the idea of the Quiet faction as having less fortification - they're better able to operate outside of their "own" areas, but their areas aren't as much of an advantage to them, or a disadvantage to others.

Seelie "purity" might be a fun creep dynamic - pretend that "purity" is sold as what the land wants, but it's more a sort of outside force that can even be expended, and must be maintained.
