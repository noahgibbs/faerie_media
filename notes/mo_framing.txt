Make the different Mos be different aspects of how things work? Big Mo for stability, Little Mo for revolution/change, Strange Mo for lateral thinking and general off-the-wall? What does that leave Tall Mo for?

I like the idea of an expansion/rewrite where Strange Mo tells the story of a Seelie captain (or similar military fae) helping a downed comrade slowly change his history to become someone who was always fine; who he is/was has drifted by the end of the story, and perhaps Mo has to explain it to the other Mos.
